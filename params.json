{"name":"Socialmedia","tagline":"Social Media Ostracism Paradigm","body":"## Welcome\r\nThe Social Media Ostracism paradigm is a web-based experimental manipulation of ostracism and social exclusion, designed for research purposes. \r\nOn this page you can find:\r\n\r\n- Preview of the paradigm (online version)\r\n- How to use the online version of the paradigm for experimental purposes\r\n- How to download & customize the study \r\n- How to install and run the downloaded versions on a personal computer\r\n- Suggestions on how to run the customized study online\r\n\r\n### Try it out\r\nTo try out the Social Media Ostracism paradigm follow this link:\r\nhttp://ostracism.github.io/preview/index.html?c=1&p=999 (exclusion condition)\r\nhttp://ostracism.github.io/preview/index.html?c=2&p=999 (inclusion condition)\r\n\r\n### More about the paradigm\r\nSocial media ostracism is a type of social exclusion which happens via social media websites, such as Facebook, Twitter, blogging platforms, or forums. In the paradigm, feelings of exclusion are conveyed through the number of \"likes\" that people receive on their personal profiles during a group intro task. A detailed description of the procedure and report of the manipulation effects can be found in this manuscript: .. \r\n\r\nWe recommend that you end the paradigm with an online survey, which contains manipulation checks, dependent measures, and/or connection to subsequent tasks. If the entire study online is conducted online and with no interruptions, the participants will be more likely to think that they are interacting with other participants (rather than computer scripts). \r\n\r\nThe Social Media Ostracism paradigm was inspired by Cyberball - a virtual ball-tossing game. You can find out more about Cyberball and research on ostracism on https://cyberball.wikispaces.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use it in an experiment\r\nTo use the paradigm in your own experiment without additional customization, you will only need the following link:\r\n\r\nhttp://ostracism.github.io/preview/index.html?c=XXXX&p=YYYY&qid=ZZZZ\r\n\r\n| Substitute...       | with...   |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:|\r\n| XXXX      | `1` for ostracism condition, `2` for inclusion, `3` for overinclusion |\r\n| YYYY      | unique participant number |\r\n| ZZZZ      | Encoded* survey ID |\r\n\r\ne.g. http://ostracism.github.io/preview/index.html?c=1&p=12&qid=http%3A%2F%2Ffppvu.qualtrics.com%2FSE%2F%3FSID%3DSV_a9u9MdnpIRuxctT\r\n\r\n> To encode your survey link, open http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/ , copy the active link to your survey, paste it, and press \"Encode.\" Then copy the new, encoded link, and paste it in the url (in place of ZZZZ).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Set it up on your own computer or server\r\nDownload the XX.zip file and extract the files to your computer (unzip). To run the study, open the file \"main.js\" in an internet browser (internet connection is not necessary).\r\n\r\nBy customizing the code, you can make changes in the following parameters: \r\n* The task instructions\r\n* Avatar pool from which the participant can choose their own avatar\r\n* Number of people the participant \"interacts\" with \r\n* Profiles (avatars + descriptions) of other group members\r\n* Number of \"likes\" received by the participant and other group members\r\n* Change the word \"like\" to another word or symbol\r\n\r\n##### To adjust various parameters:\r\n\r\n1. Open the file main.js (from the folder on your computer) in a source code editor (e.g. Notepad++) \r\n2. Open the Instructions-MainJS document: \r\n3. The code you see in the editor (main.js) matches the code you see on the right side of the instructions document \r\n4. Change the text in the main.js file on your computer (using the editor), according to the instructions document\r\n5. Save the changes made to the main.js document\r\n\r\n##### To change the group member profiles (descriptions and avatars):\r\n\r\n1. Open the file tmpl_others.js (from the folder on your computer) in a source code editor (e.g. Notepad++) \r\n2. Open the Instructions-OthersJS document: \r\n3. Change the text in the index.html file on your computer (using the editor), according to the instructions document\r\n4. Save the changes made to the index.html document\r\n##### To change the study instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Open the file index.html (from the folder on your computer) in a source code editor (e.g. Notepad++) \r\n2. Open the Instructions-IndexHTML document: \r\n3. Change the text in the index.html file on your computer (using the editor), according to the instructions document\r\n4. Save the changes made to the index.html document\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
