In the paradigm, feelings of exclusion are conveyed through the number of \"likes\" that people receive on their personal profiles during a group intro task. A detailed description of the procedure and report of the manipulation effects can be found in this manuscript: .. \r\n\r\nWe recommend that you end the paradigm with an online survey, which contains manipulation checks, dependent measures, and/or connection to subsequent tasks. If the entire study is conducted online and with no interruptions, the participants will be more likely to think that they are interacting with other participants (rather than computer scripts). \r\n\r\nThe Social Media Ostracism paradigm was inspired by Cyberball - a virtual ball-tossing game. You can find out more about Cyberball and research on ostracism on https://cyberball.wikispaces.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use it in an experiment\r\nTo use the paradigm in your own experiment without additional customization of instructions, or timing, you will only need to modify the following link:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nhttp://ostracism.github.io/preview/index.html?c=XX&p=YY&qid=ZZ\r\n```\r\n\r\n| Substitute...       | with...   |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:|\r\n| XX             | `1` for ostracism condition, `2` for inclusion, `3` for overinclusion |\r\n| YY             | unique participant number |\r\n| ZZ             | Encoded* survey link |\r\n\r\n> To encode your survey link, open http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/ paste the link to your survey in the textbox, and press \"Encode.\" Use the encoded survey link as part of the URL in place of ZZ. \r\n\r\nIf you wanted to set up the study for participant number 5, who should be in the inclusion condition, and you want to redirect the participant to a Qualtrics questionaire available under the address [http://fppvu.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_a9u9MdnpIRuxctT](http://fppvu.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_a9u9MdnpIRuxctT), the link to the study should be as follows:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nhttp://ostracism.github.io/preview/index.html?c=2&p=5&qid=http%3A%2F%2Ffppvu.qualtrics.com%2FSE%2F%3FSID%3DSV_a9u9MdnpIRuxctT\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the paradigm is finished, the participant will be redirected to the survey link as specified by the parameter ZZ. Any survey link can be specified. The script will extend the survey link by additional variables that can be read out by the survey, mainly to pass on the condition, participant number. In addition, also information about the chosen avatar, the username and description provided by the participant are transmitted, these may be analysed in order to identify participants who did not take the paradigm seriously (e.g. nonsense description provided). \r\n\r\nIn our example, the participant could be redirected to the following URL after the paradigm is finished:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nhttp://fppvu.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_a9u9MdnpIRuxctT&c=2p=5&a=1&u=JohnDoe&d=ABC\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich would mean that the sample participant no. 5, who was in condition 2, chose JohnDoe as a username and described himself with the text ABC.\r\n\r\n[Here you can download a sample Qualtrics questionaire](Insert Link), that reads out the transmitted variables, and provides a number of follow-up questions as manipulation check. [More information about how to import a questionaire into Qualtrics](http://www.qualtrics.com/university/researchsuite/advanced-building/advanced-options-drop-down/import-and-export-surveys/).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Set it up on your own computer or server\r\nFor more customization, such as modified task instructions, or different timing of the paradigm, you can download the source code of the paradigm.\r\nDownload the code as a ZIP (or TAR) file and extract the files to your computer. To run the study, open the file \"index.html\" in an internet browser. By default, an internet connection will still be necessary as not all Javascript libraries are included in the ZIP file. \r\n\r\nBy customizing the code, you can easily make changes to the following parameters: \r\n* The task instructions\r\n* Avatar pool from which the participant can choose their own avatar\r\n* Number of people the participant \"interacts\" with\r\n* Profiles (avatars + descriptions) of other group members\r\n* Number of \"likes\" received by the participant and other group members\r\n* Change the word \"like\" to another word or symbol\r\n\r\n##### To adjust various settings:\r\n\r\n1. Open the file main.js (from the folder on your computer) in a source code editor (e.g. [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)) \r\n2. In the beginning of the code, variables for settings are defined, including the length of the task, and the number of likes participants reveice in each condition. Comments explaining the variables are provided in the code.\r\n4 Change variables in the main.js file on your computer (using the editor), according to the instructions document\r\n5. Save the changes made to the main.js document\r\n\r\nAn overview of the all settings in main.js, including instructions.\r\n\r\n##### To change the group member profiles (descriptions and avatars):\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to change the group member profiles (descriptions and avatars) open the file profiles.js in a source code editor, and adjust the contents to your needs. \r\n\r\nThe following scheme applies to user profiles:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n        \"avatar\": \"avatars/others/george.png\",\r\n        \"username\": \"Georgeee\",\r\n        \"text\": \"I'm a 19 year old dude from Wisconsin (commence making fun of my accent). I love music and lately you can catch me listening to nothing but Joy Division, Echo & the bunnymen, and the smiths. Besides music I like learning languages, psychology, drawing, and writing.\",\r\n        \"likes\": [45000, 50000, 110000, 150000]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe avatars used in the previews are subject to copyrights and you will need to create your own avatars. The new avatars have to be 250x250px, placed in the subfolder \"others\" (located inside the folder \"avatars\" in the main study folder you extracted on your computer or server). The names of the image files should match the names in the source code (including whether the file extension is upper or lower case). For example, \"avatars/others/george.png\" will correspond to a file called \"george.png\" and placed in the subfolder others (avatar/others).\r\n\r\n##### To change the study instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Open the file index.html (from the folder on your computer) in a source code editor (e.g. Notepad++)\r\n2. Open the Instructions-IndexHTML document:\r\n3. Change the text in the index.html file on your computer (using the editor), according to the instructions document\r\n4. Save the changes made to the index.html document","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
